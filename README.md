## Problem statement
AtliQ hardware is a company which delivers computer hardware & peripheral Manufacturers to his clients, which has several branches throughout India. The sales director of the company is facing a lot of issues in terms of understanding how the business is performing and what are all the problem company is facing currently as the sales are not as expected and declining gradually. And whenever he calls the regional managers to get the current status of the sales and market, as a human behaviour, these people sugar cote the truth and send tons of Excel files instead of disclosing the truth, which made the sales director more frustrated. Humans are not comfortable in consuming numbers from excel files, which is obvious reason for the frustration.

## Data Sources 
Sales data : The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "db_dump" sql file, containing detailed information about each sale made by the company.

### Tools
- MySQL server - Data cleaning and Data Analysis
- Power BI - Creating reports

## Solution
Sales director of the AltiQ hardware, decided to build a PowerBI Dashboard for converting the data into visual representation to make data driven decisions. So, he hired a team of data people to complete this task.

## AIMS Grid
By using the AIMS grid project management tool, we made sure what are the purpose, stakeholder, end result and success criteria of our project.
